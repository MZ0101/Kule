# Simulation of bouncing balls
The program is used to simulate the behavior of balls in a closed 2D space. You can place 100 balls at the very beginning and add another 100 during the simulation.
Currently, the standard unit used in simulation is the number of pixels. Simulation created using the Qt library.

The simulation takes into account the effect of gravity, with the option of reversing its effect and turning it off completely.
Moreover, balls already placed in a closed space can be given a speed of -10 to 10 pixels. The entire space can be cleared and the balls added again.
The program was created for testing purposes, it is planned to switch to a physical engine for better collision detection and visualize the results with the support of the Qt library.

### **Possible extensions to the current program:**
- introduction of more solid shapes
- rescaling pixels to meters
- switch to 3D
- expansion of the interface
